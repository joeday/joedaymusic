# For anyone cracking open the hood...

[joeday.music](joeday.music) is a static site built using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and attempting to be as simple to manage as possible using (mostly) free services.

Like many people who make music or some kind of art, I have a day job. My day job is designing enterprise software at a major tech company. Funny enough, my path to that career came through music. When I was in high school, my band Puppet (hell yeah, bro) needed flyers when we'd play shows. My school had a brand new computer lab, so I'd get my school work done and then use my free time to goof around and make the stupidest flyers ever. But they worked. Over time, I got better at it. Then other bands started asking me to do it for them. Then t-shirts. Then CD art. Then web sites. I learned by doing, paying attention to what other people were doing and trying to figure out how they did it. By the time I landed my first full-time web design job, web standards were emerging. [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) was building a community for people who make web sites and I gobbled up everything they published. Being in a small agency, not only did I need to be able to design for web standards, I also had to be able to build the site I had designed. This site, like my album Halflight, is me getting back to my roots. It's a labor of love for me because at work I no longer get to build the sites I design - we have entire teams of engineers who do that.

Does this site represent the best of my design thinking and execution? Nope. I only have so much time and I'd rather put as much of that into the music as possible. But, I do care that it represents the art well enough, is accessible to everyone, and open to anyone who is curious. Hence this readme.

If you find an error, or a bug, or if something is not accessible, feel free to create an issue. Heck, you can even put up a pull request if you're so inclined. That'd be amazing. Or, if you're not a technical person, just shoot me an email <joe@joedaymusic.com>.

Enjoy. :)
